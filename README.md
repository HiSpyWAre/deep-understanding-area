14/09/2025 == here's my schema to coding consistently everyday. It through "PROJECT LADDER" :
**Project 1 : Calculator CLI**✅
🛑 Learn variables, input/output, conditionals, loops.
🛑 Do +, −, ×, ÷ with error handling (e.g., divide by zero).

**Project 2: Number Guessing Game**
🛑 Add randomness (random module).
🛑 Practice loops, conditionals, and user input.

**Project 3: Multiplication Table Generator**
🛑 Generate tables up to n × 10.
🛑 Practice nested loops and formatting output.

**Project 4: To-do List (CLI, basic)**
🛑 Store tasks in a list.
🛑 Options: add, view, delete.
🛑 Reinforces list operations and menus.

**Project 5: Contact Book (Dictionary-based)**
🛑 Store name → phone number pairs.
🛑 Search contact by name.
🛑 Reinforces dictionary usage.

Project 6: Banking App (Functions)

Balance, deposit, withdraw as separate functions.

Add input validation (no negative balance).

Teaches modular programming.

Project 7: Math Toolkit

Functions for prime check, factorial, GCD/LCM.

Build a CLI menu to choose which function to run.

Reinforces reusability and math logic.

Project 8: Student Class (OOP)

Class Student with attributes: name, ID, GPA.

Methods: update GPA, display info.

Teaches object-oriented concepts.

Project 9: Library System (OOP + Multiple Classes)

Classes: Book, Member, Borrow.

Borrow a book → mark availability.

Builds on OOP with relationships.

Project 10: Notes App (File Handling)

User can write notes → saved to notes.txt.

Option to read notes back later.

Teaches file I/O.

Project 11: Expense Tracker (File Handling + CSV)

Save expenses in CSV.

Read back and calculate total per category.

Introduces structured file formats.

Project 12: Student Database (SQLite)

Add/search students in a database.

Store name + GPA, query for top GPA.

Teaches SQL + Python integration.

Project 13: To-do List (with Database)

Upgrade Project 4 by storing tasks in SQLite.

CRUD: add, mark as done, delete.

Bridges CLI → persistent apps.

Project 14: Flask Hello World Website

Serve a webpage with Flask.

Simple route: /hello/<name> → shows “Hello, [name]”.

First step into web backend.

Project 15: Web To-do List App (Final)

Upgrade Project 13 with Flask.

User can add tasks in a form → stored in SQLite → displayed in browser.

Optional: Add login system.

🎉 Now you have your first full-stack project!
