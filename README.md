14/09/2025 == here's my schema to coding consistently everyday. It through "PROJECT LADDER" :

# 🚀 Python Project Ladder

A progressive set of **15 beginner-to-intermediate Python projects**, designed to build up programming skills step by step.  
Each project introduces **new concepts** while reinforcing previous lessons, so by the end you’ll have your **first full-stack app**.

- CLI menu to choose which function to run.  
- Reinforces reusability and math logic.  

---

### **Project 8: Student Class (OOP)**✅
- Class `Student` with attributes: `name`, `ID`, `GPA`.  
- Methods: update GPA, display info.  
- Teaches object-oriented concepts.  

---

### **Project 9: Library System (OOP + Multiple Classes)**

- Teaches SQL + Python integration.  

---

### **Project 13: To-do List (with Database)**
