14/09/2025 == here's my schema to coding consistently everyday. It through "PROJECT LADDER" :

# 🚀 Python Project Ladder

A progressive set of **15 beginner-to-intermediate Python projects**, designed to build up programming skills step by step.  
Each project introduces **new concepts** while reinforcing previous lessons, so by the end you’ll have your **first full-stack app**.  

---

## 📂 Project List

### **Project 1: Calculator (CLI)**
- Learn variables, input/output, conditionals, loops.  
- Support +, −, ×, ÷ with error handling (e.g., divide by zero).  

---

### **Project 2: Number Guessing Game**
- Use the `random` module for randomness.  
- Practice loops, conditionals, and user input.  

---

### **Project 3: Multiplication Table Generator**
- Generate tables up to `n × 10`.  
- Practice nested loops and output formatting.  

---

### **Project 4: To-do List (CLI, basic)**
- Store tasks in a **list**.  
- Options: add, view, delete.  
- Reinforces list operations and menu systems.  

---

### **Project 5: Contact Book (Dictionary-based)**
- Store name → phone number pairs in a dictionary.  
- Search contacts by name.  
- Reinforces dictionary usage.  

---

### **Project 6: Banking App (Functions)**
- Separate functions for balance, deposit, withdraw.  
- Input validation (e.g., no negative balance).  
- Teaches modular programming.  

---

### **Project 7: Math Toolkit**
- Functions for prime check, factorial, GCD/LCM.  
- CLI menu to choose which function to run.  
- Reinforces reusability and math logic.  

---

### **Project 8: Student Class (OOP)**
- Class `Student` with attributes: `name`, `ID`, `GPA`.  
- Methods: update GPA, display info.  
- Teaches object-oriented concepts.  

---

### **Project 9: Library System (OOP + Multiple Classes)**
- Classes: `Book`, `Member`, `Borrow`.  
- Borrow a book → mark availability.  
- Builds on OOP with relationships.  

---

### **Project 10: Notes App (File Handling)**
- Write notes → saved to `notes.txt`.  
- Option to read notes back later.  
- Teaches file I/O.  

---

### **Project 11: Expense Tracker (File Handling + CSV)**
- Save expenses in CSV.  
- Read back and calculate totals per category.  
- Introduces structured file formats.  

---

### **Project 12: Student Database (SQLite)**
- Add/search students in a database.  
- Store name + GPA, query for top GPA.  
- Teaches SQL + Python integration.  

---

### **Project 13: To-do List (with Database)**
- Upgrade Project 4 with SQLite.  
- CRUD: add, mark as done, delete.  
- Bridges CLI → persistent apps.  

---

### **Project 14: Flask Hello World Website**
- Serve a webpage with Flask.  
- Route: `/hello/<name>` → shows “Hello, [name]”.  
- First step into web backend.  

---

### **Project 15: Web To-do List App (Final)**
- Upgrade Project 13 with Flask + SQLite.  
- Add tasks via form → stored in DB → displayed in browser.  
- Optional: Add login system.  
- 🎉 First full-stack project complete!
